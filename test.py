So what can small and medium-sized businesses do? For starters, read the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security&#8217;s guide to baseline security controls. These are things your firm should be looking at to improve security. Released this week, it&#8217;s not a comprehensive list of what should be done &#8212; maybe your firm is too small to do them all. However, it&#8217;s worth reading to get an idea of what companies with fewer than 500 employees can do to lower the odds of being hit. Briefly, that includes making an inventory of all the hardware, software and data the company has, establishing the value of the data, developing a plan for detecting, monitoring and responding to incidents, and ensuring staff are trained on security. Good cyber security needs to be done in a methodical way. This guide will get you going.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cyber.gc.ca\/en\/guidance\/baseline-cyber-security-controls-small-and-medium-organizations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">You can find it here. <\/a>The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security is the government&#8217;s one-stop place for cyber information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Think that text message on your Android phone<\/strong> is from your bank? Think again. A Russian-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.group-ib.com\/media\/gustuff\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">security vendor called Group-IB s<\/a>ays it has discovered new malware that tries to convince users of Android phones they&#8217;re being sent messages from their bank or a cypto system like Bitcoin Wallet. Whoever is behind this is not only going after money in your account, they&#8217;re also looking for cryptocurrency. Perhaps as many as 27 American banks are being targeted, including Bank of America, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Capital One and TD Bank. When victims click on a link in the text message the malware is downloaded. Ultimately it tries to trick you into thinking you&#8217;ve connected with your bank. The malware can automatically fill in the password fields from data already stored on your phone. It also has techniques to bypass security. This is one dangerous piece of code. So not only do banks have to improve their apps, you have to be careful on what you&#8217;re clicking on when you get a text or an email.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shodan is a search engine<\/strong> you might not have heard of. It indexes any device that&#8217;s connected to the Internet, from surveillance cameras to servers. It can tell smart users which devices aren&#8217;t secured, which can be handy for hackers. This week the company announced an extension of its paid service for businesses<a href=\"https:\/\/monitor.shodan.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> called Monitor<\/a>. IT staff can use it to watch what&#8217;s being connected to the Internet from their company they might not know about.

Welcome to Hashtag Trending. It\u2019s Friday, March 29th, and I\u2019m your host, Tom Li.<\/p>\n<p>In Tuesday\u2019s episode of Hashtag trending, we talked about hackers using Asus\u2019 Live Update tool to distribute hardware. According to the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Labs, the malware, called ShadowHammer, has been distributed to 1 million machines and contained specific instructions for 600 devices. Asus has since then patched its Live Update tool and has released a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.asus.com\/News\/hqfgVUyZ6uyAyJe1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vulnerability checker<\/span><\/a> for antsy users. It also urges anyone who\u2019s been affected to contact Asus support immediately.<\/p>\n<p>Trending on <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/news\/2019\/03\/standing-against-hate\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google<\/span><\/a>, Facebook has banned white separatists groups on Facebook and Instagram, citing that after research with race relation experts, they can not be effectively distinguished from white supremacists. While Facebook continues to allow people to express their ethnic pride, it will no longer tolerate support for white separatism. In a stern blog post, Facebook also wants to improve its ability to find and remove hate speech. It\u2019s even looking to provide people associated with hate groups resources to help them understand the benefits of social harmony.<\/p>\n<p>If you frequent the Twitter app on your iPhone, then you should be glad to hear that Twitter has released an all-black <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Twitter\/status\/1111312068911611904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1111312068911611904&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F3%2F28%2F18285710%2Ftwitter-dark-mode-lights-out-even-darker-oled-phones-screens\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lights Out<\/span><\/a> mode for iOS users.

When people left for the day they didn&#8217;t have to scan their parking passes or pay for parking. The entry gate was up and anyone could park for free.<\/p>\n<p>One of those using the lot was Spencer Callaghan, a spokesperson for the Canadian Internet Registry Authority (CIRA), which oversees the .ca domain.

But, they should not be looking to existing technologies to solve these problems, he said. Instead, they need to take a step back and decide what their architecture needs to look like in order to achieve their business objectives.<\/p>\n<p>There are four key things to consider when developing the new architecture, Hashmi told webinar participants. Organizations need to know: who the stakeholders that need access to the data are; all of the systems or platforms they\u2019re using; the types of data they use, and what the stakeholders need to do with the data.<\/p>\n<p>As well, Hashmi has developed a maturity model so that organizations can understand where they are now, and the investment needed to achieve their goals. Each level in the model is based on how well the organization is gaining value from its data. Organizations move up the scale as they enable individual productivity, team collaboration and automated business processes.\u00a0 \u201cAt the end is the holy grail concept of the intelligent enterprise where data is driving intelligent decisions,\u201d said Hashmi.\u00a0 \u201cBut you have to go through each step to get there,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to get started<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Once they\u2019ve determined their business goals, companies should not launch into buying more systems, said Hashmi. Rather, they should implement horizontal platforms across the organization to manage content, identities, business process automation and analytics. \u201cThen they can create microservices to tie that platforms together like a lego set,\u201d Hashmi said.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to content management, this approach ensures that data is pulled from different sources, but stored in one secure place, with policy controls in place. All access to the data is tracked and recorded.<\/p>\n<p>ATB Financial adopted this approach to provide more modern and mobile banking services to its clients.

According to a Verge article, NetDotSolutions, Higher Goals Marketing, Veterans of America, and Pointbreak Media were responsible for billions of robot calls between 2017 and 2018. Nature of these calls ranged from marketing scams, fake debt relief services, and duping people into donating to fake charities. The companies chose to settle with massive fines, which ranged from $500,000 to $3.62 million. In addition, the settlement barred these companies from ever running robot calling services again.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s all the tech news that\u2019s trending right now.

Since it was founded in 2001, the vendor has focused on simplifying management of enterprise domain name space (DNS), and the Github is just another step in that direction. DNS is a fundamental layer of network technology, with many more abstracted networking services hooking into it. Every time a new server is provisioned, or a cloud instance is spun up, or a VoIP desk phone is plugged in, the enterprise DNS directory must be updated somewhere down the chain.<\/p>\n<p>With the trend of network virtualization pushing more automated packaging of networking functions all the time, the number of integrations BlueCat is developing is multiplying. BlueCat&#8217;s customers need to tailor their DNS environments to talk to other platforms integral to their infrastructure. To make that easier, the BlueCat Gateway product that allows those integrations to be coded with Python. At the same time, it launched <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bluecatlabs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BlueCat Labs<\/a> to share workflows for Gateway, creating a community where BlueCat employees and users could collaborate. Now with nine repositories on Github, the space is being used to push the boundaries of automated service and explore new integrations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Think of it like a cookbook,&#8221; says Andrew Wertkin, chief technology officer at BlueCat. &#8220;We want to provide as many examples as possible to our customers of the types of automation that we&#8217;re seeing other customers do in general bootstrapping.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Customers also want to interface with other open source networking platforms, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/tag\/kubernetes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kubernetes<\/a> and OpenStack. The nature of these technologies sees them deployed into environments with specific tweaks. As a result, BlueCat can&#8217;t practically create one configuration for all of its customers. So opening up the Gateway access to an open source community allows customers to accomplish things more quickly. Plus, BlueCat&#8217;s business strategy isn&#8217;t to make money by charging customers for the different integrations they need to add on. Instead, it&#8217;s providing a critical node that is flexible enough to maintain its relevance.<\/p>\n<p>BlueCat Gateway is also <a href=\"https:\/\/quay.io\/repository\/bluecat\/gateway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available through Quay.io<\/a>, a repository of container images. The fact users can click a button to deploy Gateway to their environments marks a big change from the days of circulating as a .tar archive file.<\/p>\n<p>BlueCat says that its customers, including some global organizations and universities, were pretty clear with their feedback. &#8220;Installation was slow and too difficult,&#8221; they were told. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just provide an image?&#8221; another said.<\/p>\n<p>So they have, in the most accessible way possible.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better for us if our customers integrate us into their IT eco-system,&#8221; Wertkin says. &#8220;They&#8217;ll deploy more of us and use more of us, and that&#8217;s great. So we have to reduce any resistance to its use.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>BlueCat says it sees close to 100 pull requests of its image from the cloud each month, from locations around the world.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Crystal ball to product&#8217;s future<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>By carving out an open source community, BlueCat has created an experimental space where its customers can dabble in extending the product&#8217;s usefulness, while guarding against breaking it when things go awry, says Jason Grant, founder of IT consultant firm The Automated Method. It&#8217;s also a way for BlueCat to see where its customers want to go.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You will learn so much about your product, you learn so much about what people want,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If you have a way to give out your products in open source to a group of people and then watch how many people will have feedback loops on something, then you immediately know what you should be focusing on. You can have foresight.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Github community also serves as an extension of BlueCat&#8217;s support-based community, Wertkin says, which also encourages collaboration between its own team and customers. In some cases, customers even chat with BlueCat engineers via a Slack channel. In others, a user may post a question to a forum that will inspire the creation of a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/tag\/Github\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github<\/a> repository. Then, the next time a BlueCat user punches the question into Google search, they&#8217;ll find the answer awaiting them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This user that&#8217;s trying to automate everything, they don&#8217;t want to call support, they don&#8217;t want to read the API manual. They want to Google something and find the answer,&#8221; Wertkin says. &#8220;It&#8217;s why we&#8217;re all going in this direction.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>BlueCat&#8217;s not alone in building community on Github.

Pancake in a statement. \u201cThe growth of and interest in AI is due, in no small part, to the recent advances in deep learning for which Bengio, Hinton and LeCun laid the foundation. These technologies are used by billions of people. Anyone who has a smartphone in their pocket can tangibly experience advances in natural language processing and computer vision that were not possible just 10 years ago.

In 1986, he co-authored a paper demonstrating that neural networks could discover their own internal representations of data using a backpropagation algorithm. This is a standard feature in most neural networks today. In 2012, he collaborated with students to improve convolutional neural networks. The result was a famous breakthrough in the ImageNet competition, where Hinton and his team halved the error rate for object recognition and redefined the approach to computer vision.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Yoshua Bengio<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/awards.acm.org\/binaries\/content\/gallery\/acm\/awards\/photo\/a-b\/bengio_3406375\" width=\"485\" height=\"550\" \/>A professor at the University of Montreal and the scientific director at Quebec&#8217;s AI Insitute Mila and the Institute for Data Valorization, as well as the co-director of CIFAR&#8217;s Learning in Machines and Brains program, Yoshua Bengio combined neural networks with probabilistic models of sequences in the 1990s. That work was used by AT&amp;T\/NCR for reading handwritten cheques and remain a foundation in modern speech recognition systems. A paper he authored in 2000 had a profound impact on natural language processing tasks such as translation and answering questions. Since 2010, his papers on Generative Adversarial Networks spurred a revolution in computer vision and graphics, allowing computers to create original images.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Yann LeCun<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/awards.acm.org\/binaries\/content\/gallery\/acm\/awards\/photo\/k-l\/lecun_6017366\" width=\"485\" height=\"550\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Silver Professor of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, vice-president and chief AI scientist at Facebook, and a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, Yann LeCun developed convolutional neural networks in the 1980s. It was essential to making neural networks more efficient and a foundational standard in many different types of machine learning. He also accelerated the backpropagation algorithms learning time using two simple methods. His work on hierarchical feature representation in neural networks is now used in many recognition-based tasks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two of Canada&#8217;s artificial intelligence (AI) pioneers have won the 2018 Association for Computing Machinery&#8217;s (ACM) A.M.

Once rolled out, it noted, 5G networks &#8220;will form the backbone for a wide range of services essential for the functioning of the internal market and the maintenance and operation of vital societal and economic functions \u2013 such as energy, transport, banking, and health, as well as industrial control systems. The organization of democratic processes, such as elections, will also rely more and more on digital infrastructure and 5G networks.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Any vulnerability in 5G networks could be exploited in order to compromise such systems and digital infrastructure \u2013 potentially causing very serious damage or in order to conduct large-scale data theft or espionage &#8230;\u00a0 This justifies the need for a robust risk-based approach, rather than one relying primarily on ex-post mitigation measures.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On March 12 the EU Parliament adopted a resolution expressing &#8220;deep concern about the recent allegations that 5G equipment developed by Chinese companies may have embedded backdoors that would allow manufacturers and authorities to have unauthorized access to private and personal data and telecommunications from the EU.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The EU recently approved a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/news\/cybersecurity-act-2018-dec-11_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cybersecurity Act<\/a>, which will shortly come into force. It will allow the creation of an EU-wide security certification framework for products, processes and services. Ultimately it will force hardware and software makers to incorporate security features in the early stages of their technical design and development. Buyers will be able to see the level of security assurance, and know that certain security features are independently verified.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of this week&#8217;s EU announcement member countries are encouraged to prioritize a certification scheme covering 5G networks and equipment.<\/p>\n<p>This year 5G-related spectrum auctions are scheduled in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Lithuania, and Portugal. Six more auctions are scheduled for 2020 in Spain, Malta, Lithuania, Slovakia, Poland, and the U.K.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p> Commission recommends common EU approach to the security of 5G networks, but will allow ban if a manufacturer doesn&#8217;t comply with its standards<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":166,"featured_media":416370,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"amp_status":""},"categories":[27536,1040],"tags":[32560,31321],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/416358"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/166"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=416358"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/416358\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":416371,"href":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/416358\/revisions\/416371"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/416370"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=416358"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=416358"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=416358"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":416343,"date":"2019-03-27T10:00:33","date_gmt":"2019-03-27T14:00:33","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/article\/\/416343"},"modified":"2019-03-26T17:04:09","modified_gmt":"2019-03-26T21:04:09","slug":"blackberry-and-telus-partner-with-ottawa-based-accelerator-for-new-iot-focused-program","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/article\/blackberry-and-telus-partner-with-ottawa-based-accelerator-for-new-iot-focused-program\/416343","title":{"rendered":"BlackBerry and Telus partner with Ottawa-based accelerator for new IoT-focused program"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Ottawa-based software as a service (SaaS) accelerator program L-Spark Corp. is launching a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.l-spark.com\/accelerator\/secureiot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Secure IoT Accelerator<\/a> program, working with Telus Corp, BlackBerry Ltd. and Solace, the group announced on Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>The program will work with Canadian ventures developing Internet of Things (IoT) products and services. With communications vendor Cisco Systems Inc. predicting the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/article\/internet-of-things-will-be-a-6-5-billion-market-in-canada-by-2018\/374109\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">global IoT market<\/a> will be worth $1.1 trillion USD by 2021, there&#8217;s plenty of incentive to develop more advanced and secure IoT technologies.<\/p>\n<p>The accelerator will not provide any funding to firms selected to take part, according to Leo Lax, the executive managing director at L-Spark. Nor do they have to pay any fee to take part or share any of the intellectual property they develop. But they do have to put their R&amp;D resources towards developing a proof of concept on a hardware and software platform being provided by the three technology firms partnered with the accelerator.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We expect these companies to recognize the advantage of being first movers in this market and use this platform to develop their product,&#8221; Lax says in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a computing platform that has secure connectivity to the Telus LTE-M network and will allow the applications to be used by end-users around the globe.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Telus is providing connectivity for the platform. BlackBerry is providing special software to enable delivery and management of the application in a secure fashion. Solace provides an event broker platform that will allow the applications to communicate with low latency.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>An accelerator by Canadian firms, for Canadian firms<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;All three companies are global in nature. All three companies are delivering first-mover technologies in their specific area. All three are based in Canada,&#8221; Lax says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a made-in-Canada accelerator for a made in Canada company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The accelerator concept was born out of conversations between L-Spark and Telus, Lax says. As the needs and features that participant companies required became clear, BlackBerry and Solace were identified as partners. L-Spark also<a href=\"https:\/\/www.itbusiness.ca\/news\/blackberry-l-spark-announce-first-cohort-for-new-tech-accelerator-program\/107791\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> collaborates with BlackBerry on another accelerator project<\/a> focused on developing technology with its QNX automotive platform.<\/p>\n<p>BlackBerry has been developing its &#8220;enterprise of things&#8221; platform with a security focus. It also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/article\/blackberry-lends-secure-hardware-assurance-to-swiss-phone-maker-punkt\/409701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">licenses its BlackBerry Secure Integrated Manufacturing Service<\/a> to other hardware manufacturers, as a way to ensure no outside actor has tampered with a device. If an authentication check with Waterloo, Ont. fails, then the device doesn&#8217;t boot.<\/p>\n<p>Telus offers its LTE-M network as a service tailored to Internet of Things devices, which typically don&#8217;t require high bandwidth, but do require low latency. Telus will also offer its IoT Cybersecurity services to the accelerator participants. Solace offers a data distribution platform that is used by enterprise clients to move hundreds of billions of events per day.<\/p>\n<p>All three firms will provide mentors to companies selected for the program, which need not relocate to Ottawa to participate, Lax explains. If a firm is already operating in Ottawa or is agile enough to move there, they&#8217;re welcome at L-Spark. But if they&#8217;re already established elsewhere in Canada, they can work with the accelerator in a more virtual fashion.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Apply before end of April<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for firms that are working on the leading edge of the environment,&#8221; Lax says. &#8220;There&#8217;s a huge benefit in using the same acceleration concept to test and validate and implement these capabilities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Applications for the program <a href=\"https:\/\/www.l-spark.com\/accelerator\/secureiot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open today<\/a>, Lax says. Interested firms will have until the end of April to apply. During this time, L-Spark and accelerator partners will be conducting a roadshow across the country to engage with interested firms on a more direct basis.<\/p>\n<p>Following that, a bootcamp-style hackathon will host about 12 finalists. A selection committee will judge their presentations and select four to six program participants.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The best of the best ideally are going to make it,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>The accelerator program will begin in June.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ottawa-based software as a service (SaaS) accelerator program L-Spark Corp. is launching a new Secure IoT Accelerator program, working with Telus Corp, BlackBerry Ltd. and Solace, the group announced on Wednesday.

The infection may have come through the Asus Live Update utility that comes with computers and laptops made by the company. It updates certain pieces of software. Normally the computer recognizes an update as safe because it comes with a piece of code called a digital certificate recognized by the utility. That&#8217;s how, for example, Windows Update recognizes that patches from Microsoft are safe. <a href=\"https:\/\/usa.kaspersky.com\/about\/press-releases\/2019_operation-shadowhammer-new-supply-chain-attack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">But security vendor Kaspersky said this week<\/a> it uncovered evidence that last year Asus Live Update was infected by attackers so it would spread malware to people who bought Asus computers. Kaspersky thinks more than a million devices may have been infected. That&#8217;s not the big worry. The big worry is that the malware isn&#8217;t after all Asus computer owners; it includes a list of 600 specific address of network adapters of computers. In other works, 600 targets.<\/p>\n<p>Three other Asian manufacturers were also infected, Kaspersky said, although it didn&#8217;t identify them. Some anti-virus or anti-malware solutions you use may detect infections. As word spreads about this their solutions will likely be updated. Asus has fixed the hole in its system.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, to find out if your computer is on the hit list, there&#8217;s a link to the Kaspersky blog in the text version of this podcast on ITWorldCanada.com. That includes a link to a tool that can check to see if your computer is on the list of targets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For some people<\/strong> creating a smartphone app is a good way to easy money &#8212; no factory to build, no stores to staff, just sit in front of a computer for a few hours, write code and watch the money roll in. However, there&#8217;s more to a software business than that. In the Internet era, make a mistake and your reputation can be seriously damaged. So you&#8217;ve got to have a way people can report mistakes so they can be quickly corrected. Here&#8217;s an example: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/23\/family-tracking-location-leak\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to TechCrunch,<\/a> an Australian developer called React Apps makes an app called Family Locator. It lets you track the devices of family members so you know where children or parents are any time. But a security reseacher this month found the company database &#8212; with usernames, email addresses and passwords &#8212; had been left open on the Internet. So anyone could have found out where users, like children, are. The researcher notified TechCrunch, which tried to warn the developer. But its website had no contact information. There was no reply to messages sent through the company&#8217;s feedback form. TechCrunch had to ask Microsoft, which hosted the company&#8217;s database on its cloud servers, to contact the developer. Within hours the open database had been shut.<\/p>\n<p>Publicity like this is not what a company needs. If you want to make it big you&#8217;ve got to think big. That means being ready to field customer complaints, and warnings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of apps,<\/strong> makers of Android devices have the freedom to install lot of third party software on smartphones they sell. These can be games or utilities. It helps differentiate one company&#8217;s phone from another&#8217;s. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/haystack.mobi\/papers\/preinstalledAndroidSW_preprint.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a detailed study by university researchers<\/a> suggests some manufacturers are careless, or lazy, in what they install. Briefly, there&#8217;s a lot of junk that comes with some phones you buy right out of the store. Some of these apps may send personal information to Facebook, Twitter, or companies you&#8217;ve never heard of. Some are potentially dangerous, others are flat-out malware that will allow an attacker to take over your device. What can you do? First, right after you buy an Android device, see what apps it has. Do they show privacy policies? Are the privacy policies clear, or so general they&#8217;re useless? Do you need the apps? If not, delete them. Unfortunately some can&#8217;t be removed. So, before you buy an Android device, ask the store what apps come with it and if they can be removed. Then make a choice. It would be nice if Google cracked down on its partners.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finally<\/strong>, those of you with Apple devices should make sure the latest iOS version is installed. Version 12.2 was released Monday to patch 51 security vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s it for Cyber Security Today.

For example, if a video on YouTube is subjected to copyright, YouTube would be legally liable. In addition, the EU has also passed Article 11, which requires news aggregators to pay publishers a fee for displaying snippets of their content. Critics fear that in compliance with the new laws, content platforms would stop linking to sources and block content. Tech companies also say that compliance would be costly as they\u2019d have to build extensive content filters. The bills have been contested for months, resulting in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/european-parliament-stop-the-censorship-machinery-save-the-internet\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition<\/span><\/a> with 5 million signatures and a protest 150,000 strong.<\/p>\n<p>Trending on <a href=\"https:\/\/mobilesyrup.com\/2019\/03\/26\/huawei-p30-and-p30-pro-canadian-pricing-availability\/\">Google<\/a>, Huawei has released its new photography-oriented P series smartphones. The flagship P30 Pro comes with three cameras, including a new periscope camera capable of 5 times optical zoom. The P30 Pro\u2019s camera is already being adored by reviewers, and has even earned 112 points on DXOMark &#8211; the highest ever achieved by a smartphone. The P30 Pro will start at 999 euros for a Kirin 980 chipset, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage.

The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus supports 25W charging, while the Oppo Find X can do so with 50W.

IT World Canada had a chance to attend an invite-only press event in NYC last week to try out these new phones.<\/p>\n<h3>Design<\/h3>\n<p>Both the P30 and P30 Pros feature glossy glass backs. This time around, Huawei introduced a few gradient color options including Breathing Crystal, Aurora, and Amber Sunrise. While the sky blue Breathing Crystal is my favourite, all three look absolutely stunning.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_416274\" class=\"wp-caption thumbnail aligncenter\" style=\"width: 600px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-416274\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"408\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1.jpg 1765w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-768x522.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">P30 under the cloudy NYC sky<\/figcaption>\r\n\t\t\t<\/figure>\n<p>Like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro released last year, the P30 Pro\u2019s curved front glass lends the phone a razor-sharp profile. The tapered edge combined with a narrow body makes the phone very comfortable to hold.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast to the P30 Pro, the P30 embraces a formal straight edge. It\u2019s difficult to objectively decide which design is best: tapered edges make the phones look thinner, but I feel like squared-off edges are grippier.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the main attraction is the P30 Pro\u2019s brand-new camera system. It now consists of four sensors: a 20MP wide-angle camera, a 40MP main camera, an 8MP periscope zoom camera, and a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor. The camera array is raised slightly and can potentially make the phone wobble when laid down flat.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-416280\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots.jpg 1800w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Besides the size difference, the most obvious visual distinction between the two is the inclusion of the periscope camera on just the Pro model.\u00a0 Instead of that feature, the P30 uses an 8MP f\/ 2.4 zoom camera capable of shooting 5x hybrid zoom. The P30 also omits wireless charging, and is only rated for IP56 weather sealing versus the P30 Pro\u2019s more robust IP68. Unfortunately, neither devices carry a headphone jack this time around.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-416276\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"566\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-3.jpg 927w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-3-768x725.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A 32MP front camera sits in the teardrop notch.<\/p>\n<h3>Camera<\/h3>\n<p>I used the P30 Pro to capture NYC\u2019s breathtaking skyscrapers. Whereas my Pixel 3 XL started to lose detail after 2x zoom, the Huawei P30 Pro maintained its sharpness all the way up to 5x zoom. In-body OIS kept the camera extremely stable, and the shutter speed was snappy in daylight.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the time constraints, I couldn\u2019t examine how and when the camera app switched between sensors. What I did notice, however, is that when left on the default settings, the main sensor wasn&#8217;t as sharp as the Pixel 3 XL. In a comparison photo, a flower petal\u2019s finer folds vividly appeared in shots taken with the Pixel 3 XL, but were lost in the P30 Pro\u2019s. Digging further, I found that the P30\u2019s main sensor shot at 10MP by default. Enabling the 40MP shooting mode disabled the ability to automatically switch to its zoom lens.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots-3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-416282\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots-3.jpg 1548w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots-3-768x595.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Low-light performance, on the other hand, is phenomenal. When challenged with a dark bar room, the new sensor still managed to capture ample light to define detail. In addition to the new sensor, noise processing has also been improved.<\/p>\n<p>Several technologies make these advancements possible. New additions like the periscope camera, Time-of-Flight sensor, and a new image sensor work together to boost image fidelity.<\/p>\n<p>In photography, long barrels are a hallmark characteristic of zoom lenses. The reason being that glass elements within them need to have enough space to concentrate light from afar. Instead of using a heavily protruding camera array, Huawei oriented the glass elements horizontally inside the phone. Light is refracted into the lens element via a prism housed in a square cutout near the base of the camera stack.<\/p>\n<p>The result is five-times lossless optical zoom, which can be stretched to a whopping 50 times digital zoom &#8211; although noise and stability become a significant issue at this extreme.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots-4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-416283\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots-4.jpg 1119w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shots-4-768x819.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The P30 Pro also includes a Time of Flight sensor (ToF) to measure depth-of-field. The ToF sensor shoots out a pulse of laser and, based on the time difference between reflected light, produces a depth-of-field (DoF) map. The image processor then applies the proper variable depth of field according to the map. A ToF sensor allows the P30 Pro to measured DoF with just one light pulse, significantly faster than previously available solutions.<\/p>\n<p>Another use for the ToF sensor is to capture 3D images. The neural-engines inside the phone can combine 2D images with the depth map to create accurate models of real-life objects.<\/p>\n<p>New lens aside, the image sensors also received an overhaul. All smartphone camera sensors typically use Bayer filters composed of a red, green, and blue (RGB) pixel array to capture light. Huawei\u2019s new sensor, on the other hand, trades the green pixels for yellow ones. According to the presentation, the new sensor allows for 40 per cent more light intake and tremendously boosts low light performance. In a comparison slide, Huawei touts that the P30 Pro is up to four times brighter than a Canon 5D professional DSLR.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t allowed to keep any image samples. That will have to wait until later.<\/p>\n<h3>Display<\/h3>\n<p>Both phones use a 2,340&#215;1,080 OLED display. Since the P30 has a smaller screen, that translates to a higher pixel density. With that said, sharpness is indistinguishable between the two.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-416275\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-2.jpg 1513w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-2-768x583.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The display was adequately bright against the harsh sunlight in the showroom and maintained color consistency when viewed off-angle. Compared to the Samsung Galaxy S10+\u2019s display (courtesy of another journalist), the Huawei P30 Pro\u2019s display felt a tad colder. This could have simply been due to different colour settings, though, so I\u2019ll withhold my opinion until the full review.<\/p>\n<h3>Software<\/h3>\n<p>Operating system quality directly affects hardware performance and user experience. In this regard, Huawei says that it has optimized the launch speed of the top 30 apps in Google Play Store and is working on more. The P30 and P30 Pro ships with Huawei\u2019s EMUI 9.1 based on Android 9, and will continue to use its proprietary EROFS filesystem that supposedly guards against performance degradation.<\/p>\n<p>Because the P30 and P30 Pro use the same Kirin 980 chipset as the Mate 20 Pro, I didn\u2019t notice a dramatic increase in performance. During my hands-on, the software ran just as smoothly as its predecessor. Its plethora of features needs will be properly dissected in the full review.<\/p>\n<p>The camera software has new AI enhancements, too. Huawei touts that the new P30 series&#8217; AI HDR+ exposure adjustment technique can more efficiently stack pictures with different exposures. Improvements have also been made to night mode and image stabilization.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-5.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-416278\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-5.jpg 1615w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-batch-1-5-768x569.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Battery<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to battery size, it&#8217;s the bigger the better. While the P30 carries a solid 3,650mAh cell, few can match the P30 Pro\u2019s colossal 4,200mAh battery. The Huawei Mate 20 Pro had the same capacity and easily lasted a day and a half when we reviewed it last year. If everything goes well, then expect the P30 Pro to have equally excellent longevity.<\/p>\n<h3>Pricing and availability<\/h3>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shot.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-416279\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shot.jpg 1449w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-p30-glamour-shot-768x605.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Those living in the U.S. won\u2019t be getting Huawei phones until its government lifts its ban.

New services include Apple TV Plus, Apple\u2019s first original content subscription service; Apple Arcade, the Apple-branded game streaming service with 100 titles upon launch; and the Apple credit card, which has no annual fees, late fees, international fees, and can earn up to 3 per cent cash back credit. Lastly, Apple released Apple News Plus, a news service that features magazines from 300 publications.<\/p>\n<p>Few things can ruin a week faster than malware. Trending on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/3\/25\/18280716\/asus-update-tool-hacked-shadowhammer-malware\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit<\/span><\/a>, Taiwanese computer hardware manufacturer Asus has fallen victim to a huge breach. According to Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, hackers were able to compromise Asus\u2019 software update system and distribute malware to about 1 million Windows PCs. It\u2019s unclear what the hackers are after, but the Verge reports that the attack seems to carry special instructions for 600 systems identified using hardware MAC addresses. Kaspersky Labs told Motherboard that it estimates hundreds of thousands of PCs have installed the payload. Asus has yet to issue a response to the breach, only saying that it will make an announcement today.<\/p>\n<p>Trending on <a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gadgets\/2019\/03\/hmd-admits-the-nokia-7-plus-was-sending-personal-data-to-china\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit<\/span><\/a>, HMD admitted that its Nokia 7 phones were sending personal data to Chinese servers.

The data exchange appear to occur every time his screen turned on, and did so in plaintext without encryption. HMD says that the information was sent in error, and was part of the activation process for users in China. It also assures that the data hasn\u2019t been processed, and has since then disabled the service through a patch.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s all the tech news that\u2019s trending right now.

But then not every client is like Ronald McDonald House Charities Toronto (RMHC Toronto).<\/p>\n<p>Volunteering in the local community is a regular part of the staff experience at Flybits, says Jay Graver, director of advanced enterprise solutions. After working to develop a mobile app with the charity, which provides a temporary home for families with seriously ill children undergoing treatment in nearby hospitals, it was only natural for about 30 to 40 employees to head over and don hairnets for Fiesta Night.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just an impersonal &#8216;here&#8217;s your app&#8217; deal,&#8221; Graver says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bigger relationship.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"thumbnail aligncenter size-full wp-image-416269\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_7276.jpeg\" alt=\"Flybits in RMHC kitchen 2\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_7276.jpeg 4032w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_7276-768x576.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Graver points out much of the work that Flybits did on the app pre-dates his time at the firm, but he&#8217;s familiar with the app and how it was built. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/tag\/flybits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flybits<\/a> bills its digital platform as an AI-engine that provides a contextually relevant experience to the user. It&#8217;s exactly what RMHC Toronto was looking for to support its clientele &#8211; families who find themselves in a strange new city during an emotionally difficult time.<\/p>\n<p>In place since 2017, the Virtual Front Desk app has received accolades from the RMHC global organization. The charity operates national governance bodies, but each of the more than 350 chapters operates independently. The Toronto chapter was Canada&#8217;s first RMHC charity, and is the largest house in Canada serving 4,735 families in 2018. It was recognized with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rmhctoronto.ca\/Our-Stories\/Stories\/2018\/RMHC-Toronto-App-Wins-Top-International-Award\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RMHC&#8217;s Kim Hill Award<\/a> for developing a first-of-its-kind innovative experience.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption thumbnail aligncenter\" style=\"width: 600px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.rmhctoronto.ca\/getattachment\/Our-Stories\/RMHC-Toronto-App-Wins-Top-International-Award\/Kim-Hill-Award-for-web-5.jpg.aspx\" alt=\"The RMHC Toronto team received the top international awrard from the global body representing 350 RMHC chapters around the world.

(Photo cred: RMHC Toronto)<\/figcaption>\r\n\t\t\t<\/figure>\n<p>The app&#8217;s development kicked off shortly after Sally Ginter became CEO of RMHC in August 2016. She spoke with IT World Canada about the award-winning app at Longview&#8217;s Activate Digital event in February.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That we were recognized by our peers is absolutely extraordinary,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s also a really good feeling knowing that we are the first Canadian chapter to have every earned that award.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>RMHC Toronto&#8217;s Associate Director of Marketing and Communications Judy Noordermeer played a key role in collaborating with Flybits, Ginter says. But developing the Virtual Front Desk to serve clients in a way that made their lives easier took a whole-team effort.<\/p>\n<p>The family services department was engaging families about what features would be most useful. The families staying at the house, which can host up to 81 in its main Toronto facility, served as test pilots for the experience and provided feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the most valuable features in the app are those that helped families understand the area they were in, stay connected to the house&#8217;s meals program schedule, and provided a direct communications channel via push notifications. Designed to answer common problems faced by house guests as quickly as possible, the app&#8217;s goal was to make its users feel more at home.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_416290\" class=\"wp-caption thumbnail aligncenter\" style=\"width: 610px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/RMHC-Toronto-Virtual-Front-Desk-iOS-app.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-416290\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/RMHC-Toronto-Virtual-Front-Desk-iOS-app.jpg\" alt=\"RMHC Toronto - Virtual Front Desk - iOS app\" width=\"610\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/RMHC-Toronto-Virtual-Front-Desk-iOS-app.jpg 1983w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/RMHC-Toronto-Virtual-Front-Desk-iOS-app-768x347.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" \/><\/a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Screenshots from the iPhone version of the Virtual Front Desk app. Click image to view a larger size.<\/figcaption>\r\n\t\t\t<\/figure>\n<p>&#8220;We have some families who woke up in the morning not thinking they were going to bed at night in a Ronald McDonald House,&#8221; Ginter says. &#8220;So we had to make sure we created an app that was easy and intuitive and answered the critical questions, particularly about the external environment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>User context that maintains privacy<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Available for free on the <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.flybits.events.rmhc&amp;hl=en_CA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Play<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/ca\/app\/virtual-front-desk\/id1318900812?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple App Store<\/a>, the app features a neighbourhood guide to finding staples like grocery stores, post offices, pharmacy, and of course the nearest McDonald&#8217;s restaurant.\u00a0 It also provides a calendar of activities in the house (Fiesta Night included), a floor plan, a program guide, and a directory of staff complete with headshots.<\/p>\n<p>The project was novel for Flybits because it usually builds its contextual engine onto an existing app, Graver says. This time, it was building it from scratch. In this case, the context comes from location.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so much who they are as where they are at the time,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;re delivering personalized information in an anonymized fashion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Given the sensitive nature of the identities of the families staying with RMHC, Flybits was careful to protect the privacy of the user from the outset. No registration for the app is required, so no personal information is recorded. Device-specific information is used to determine location, and all logs are purged on a regular basis. There&#8217;s no reversible way to identify any users from the data, according to Graver.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_416291\" class=\"wp-caption thumbnail aligncenter\" style=\"width: 396px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\" wp-image-416291\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190228_194607.jpg\" alt=\"RMHC Toronto CEO Sally Ginter receives a $10,000 donation from Long View Systems at Activate Digital 2019. \" width=\"396\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190228_194607.jpg 1301w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/IMG_20190228_194607-768x1163.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" \/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">RMHC Toronto CEO Sally Ginter receives a $10,000 donation from Long View Systems at Activate Digital 2019.

This might determine what notifications they receive.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have some very generous donors and they will occasionally bring us Toronto Maple Leaf tickets,&#8221; Ginter says, sharing an example. &#8220;So what better way to let families know than to do a push notification, saying &#8216;come on down to the front desk, put your name in the raffle, and cross your fingers, you might be off to the game tonight.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In another situation, RMHC Toronto received a warning from Toronto Police that an individual in the neighbourhood had been reported as possibly wanting to cause harm.

Some details about the device leaked last week, so we know it will have four cameras. That will include a 40 megapixel sensor and a 10x hybrid zoom. The P30 Pro will have a low light sensor. There\u2019s also an interesting video mode, which will show you a split screen of the video from two different cameras at once.

Click on a link in the message and you get infected &#8212; with ransomware. The lure is in the subject line, which reads, &#8220;Flu pandemic warning.&#8221; Use of words like &#8220;warning,&#8221; &#8220;alert,&#8221; and &#8220;urgent&#8221; are triggers attackers hope will make you worried, and want to read and act on the message. In this case the message says &#8220;You should take a look at this important announcement.&#8221; which includes an attachment that supposedly has health instructions. This is a con.<\/p>\n<p>One of the ways to make sure you&#8217;re not taken in is to be wary about messages that ask you to quickly click on a link or an attachment. And look in the &#8220;From&#8221; field in the message. Who is it coming from? Make sure you&#8217;ve got the settings turned on that show the full address of the sender. It&#8217;s easy for a hacker to put &#8220;Centres for Disease Control&#8221; or a company name in the sender field. But if you can see the full email address you&#8217;ll have a better idea if it&#8217;s legit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of ransomware<\/strong>, Orange County North Carolina <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankinfosecurity.com\/north-carolina-county-suffers-repeat-ransomware-infections-a-12217\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">was hit for the third time in six years<\/a> last week. Some of the 100 computers affected include the library, the tax department, the planning board, the registrar of deeds and the sheriff&#8217;s office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In one of my podcasts last week<\/strong> I talked about companies falling for invoice scams, where employees get suckered into sending money to a phony company or bank account controlled by a criminal. Insurance company Beazley<a href=\"https:\/\/www.beazley.com\/news\/2019\/beazley_breach_briefing_2019.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> just released a report<\/a> giving an idea of how big this and similar cons are. Experts call it the business email compromise, and Beazley says it accounted for 24 per cent of the 3,300 data incidents reported by customers last year. That&#8217;s up 10 per cent over 2017. Your firm can avoid being victimized by warning staff to be careful of messages asking for money to be transferred on an urgent basis, to check if a supplier asks for a change of address or bank account and by limiting the number of people who can authorize wire transfers. Some of these cons are aided by breaking into people&#8217;s email, so use of multi-factor authentication for logins also helps.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finally,<\/strong> GitHub is an open platform where software developers can create and collaborate on applications while keeping control over the versions they work on. So it&#8217;s helpful. It can also be a dangerous place for security breaches if developers aren&#8217;t careful. That came through from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/over-100000-github-repos-have-leaked-api-or-cryptographic-keys\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a recent study by North Carolina State University researchers<\/a> who discovered over 100,000 software repositories had exposed security tokens and cryptographic keys. These are pieces of code used, for example, in your browser to confirm you have a secure link with a bank or an online shopping site. A hacker scanning GitHub might discover some very valuable keys allowing them to break into companies or governments. This isn&#8217;t a new problem. Software developers using GitHub and other code-sharing repositories have got to do a better job of protecting their data, particularly when using tokens and keys.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s it for Cyber Security Today.

Because HoloLens isn\u2019t marketed to consumers, not everyone may be familiar with its purpose. For those who aren\u2019t in tune with HoloLens, it\u2019s Microsoft\u2019s augmented reality glasses designed for the enterprise. Microsoft\u2019s vision for HoloLens is to provide robust instant wireless AR content to enable hands-free operation for professional work.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"770\" height=\"433\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eqFqtAJMtYE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>The new HoloLens brings several improvements over the original. A foremost focus for HoloLens 2 is comfort. When the user must wear it for hours on end, the headset shouldn\u2019t cause any pain. In addition to using a new lightweight carbon fiber front enclosure, HoloLens 2 now more efficiently balances weight, reducing strain on the wearer\u2019s neck.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Microsoft-HoloLens-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-416253 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Microsoft-HoloLens-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>HoloLens 2 also doubles the field of view, which means more information at a glance and less head movement. Despite the enlarged viewport, Microsoft has maintained the 47 pixels-per-degree required to read 8pt font. The depth of field perception has also been reworked for a better depth of field.<\/p>\n<p>In the near future, HoloLens 2 will be able to offload computing to Microsoft Azure GPU stack for even faster and more elaborate content. Using Azure will enable HoloLens to display dynamic holograms with a much higher polygon count.<\/p>\n<p>A small but important feature is the ability to flip up the visor. This may sound like a no brainer, but being able to toggle between hologram and reality with minimal interruption to workflow is one of HoloLens\u2019 key features.<\/p>\n<p>Internally, HoloLens 2 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 SoC, but the real secret sauce is Microsoft\u2019s 2nd generation custom holographic processing unit. The glasses render according to eyes\u2019 positions, and support a 2k resolution, 3:2 aspect ratio display. The integrated camera captures 8MP still images and 1080p videos at 30fps. To accept voice commands, HoloLens 2 also has a 5-channel microphone array. Its battery lasts two to three hours of active use and supports Fast Charging over USB.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, HoloLens is already being used in industries like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unrealengine.com\/en-US\/blog\/epic-games-announces-unreal-engine-support-for-microsoft-hololens-2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">game design<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.windows.com\/windowsexperience\/2018\/03\/08\/how-mixed-reality-is-changing-the-game-for-healthcare-from-performing-live-surgeries-to-delivering-ultrasounds-in-3d\/#yHcgRybteJgiCJMg.97\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">healthcare<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.windows.com\/windowsexperience\/2018\/04\/23\/mixed-reality-in-manufacturing-comes-to-life-at-hannover-messe\/#pAO2ioTMxiWRHu2f.97\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">manufacturing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.msdn.microsoft.com\/uk_faculty_connection\/2018\/02\/28\/hololens-mr-apps-for-education\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">immersive learning<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pHjjqKLFMXM&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">engineering.<\/span><\/a> An engineer could overlay diagrams and labels over a machine, or a doctor could use it to guide him through complex surgeries. Craig Cincotta, Microsoft senior director for communications for business applications, noted a doctor in China who performed over 300 surgeries using the HoloLens, and that several major car manufacturers are using HoloLens in their design process.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HoloLens2_Healthcare2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-416254\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HoloLens2_Healthcare2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cEssentially, any time you need to have a large scale model of something, holographic display is a tremendous way for people to save time, energy, and money,\u201d said Cincotta. He then described a scenario where HoloLens enables Japan Airline engineers to work in jet engines while it simulates what operation is like when the engine is turned on.<\/p>\n<h3>Hands-on<\/h3>\n<p>Microsoft took us through three demos, each showcasing how HoloLens can be used in a different industry.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve worn any virtual reality headset before, then putting on the HoloLens 2 should feel very natural. It was simply a matter of pressing the headpiece against my forehead and tightening the rachet at the back. The spacious area behind the visor easily accommodated for my glasses.<\/p>\n<p>Following a short intro animation came eye-tracking calibration. The demo unit had me focus on a series of targets, but this tool will not be available for the final release.<\/p>\n<p>The first demo showcased a wind-turbine placement planning scenario. A plot of land hovered in the air, with several spinning wind turbines installed.<\/p>\n<p>It was at this stage that I began to be impressed by the HoloLens 2. The animation was fluid and the colors vibrant. The resolution and brightness were adequate enough to block out the background in a brightly lit room. Object\u2019s size and perspective adapted flawlessly with changing distance and viewing angle thanks to spacial anchoring, a technique to fix a holographic image in place.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HoloLens2_ExplodedView_8k.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-416256\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HoloLens2_ExplodedView_8k.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HoloLens2_ExplodedView_8k.jpg 8192w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HoloLens2_ExplodedView_8k-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I was then asked to grab the hologram, undoubtedly to experience the improved articulate hand tracking. Reaching my hands forwards produced a frame around the model which can be selected by pinching my fingers. This allowed me to resize the model and move it around the room. Once placed, the object is anchored to the new location.<\/p>\n<p>As impressive as it was, articulate hand tracking encompasses more than just simple hand gestures. The release version will allow its users to manipulate holographic buttons and objects just like in the real world.<\/p>\n<p>The second station showcased how HoloLens is used in modeling and usefulness of the perspectives. It started with an isolated close-up model of the wind turbine from the previous demo, followed by a 3D render of its electric generator. The generator model could be rotated with two hands. When flipped to its backside, it revealed its interior structure.<\/p>\n<p>The third station shows a potential application in the education space and eye-tracking. Interestingly, the demo initiated using a voice command. Looking at the appropriate section on the wall produced several colorful gems and a polygonal hummingbird. The hummingbird floated above my hand when I held out my palm, and flew away when I closed my hand. The gems in the background burst when I fixed my sight upon them.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HoloLens2_Ratcheting_Lifestyle.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-416259\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HoloLens2_Ratcheting_Lifestyle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Activating all the gems led me to a panel of information on hummingbirds. The textbox tracked your sight position and automatically scrolled as I reached the end of the page. Scrolling back up followed the same concept; all that was needed was looking at the top of the page. The text was very clear and not at all straining to read.<\/p>\n<h3>Availability<\/h3>\n<p>When I attended the demo, there were only four units in the world. Cincotta said HoloLens 2\u2019s official availability will be \u201csome time this year\u201d for around USD$3,500 per unit. Again, it\u2019s important to note that this device is only for commercial channels, so don\u2019t hold your breath if you want one to watch Netflix.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a meeting with several Canadian jouralists, Microsoft Corp. held a hands-on demo for the HoloLens 2 mixed-reality headset first revealed at MWC 2019 in Barcelona.

Typically made from machined aluminum, extraction shoes usually weigh 575 g, cost nearly $450 to produce, and take three to five days to make.

The printer\u2019s large bed allows it to print greater volumes of smaller components.<\/p>\n<p>About a third of the world\u2019s energy is consumed in traditional manufacturing, according to HP, and during his keynote presentation this week, Shane Wall, HP\u2019s chief technology officer, said there is an opportunity to influence corporate behaviour around sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe can save 25 per cent of the total energy use by focusing on&#8230;digital manufacturing,\u201d he said, alluding to 3D printing and the software powering design processes. &#8220;Digital manufacturing offers us one of the biggest opportunities to make an impact.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As expected, HP Inc. is seeing wider adoption of 3D printing globally, so it\u2019s no surprise partners keep asking Christoph Schell how they can get in on the action. \u201cI get asked this 101 times a day,\u201d the president of 3D printing and digital manufacturing told reporters at HP Reinvent.

Contests like these help find bugs before criminals do, and help teach companies how to code better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finally, police in the U.K.<\/strong> have opened a criminal investigation into a ransomware attack that hit the computer systems and email service of the police association. The incident started over a week ago <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2019\/03\/21\/police_federation_ransomware_attack\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">but word is only now getting out<\/a>. Data on computers was encrypted. Unfortunately the attack also deleted crucial backup data. That&#8217;s usually a sign the backup system wasn&#8217;t properly isolated from the main network. Backups are an essential defence against ransomware. If your backup is connected all the time to your system, it&#8217;s going to be infected as well. The police association doesn&#8217;t think it was a targeted attack.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s it for Cyber Security Today.

It is already using the technology in supply chain management and is looking at other business applications such as data sharing and payment systems.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Since we are in the clinical trial business, we realized that the ecosystem is very complex, with many stakeholders, resulting in limited trust, transparency, little patient empowerment, high inefficiency, process inefficiency, that may impact trial quality and increases cost,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With this in mind, since we believe in partnering for success, we approached IBM with the project to ultimately improve patient care and serve patients in the healthcare system.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He went on, &#8220;Our understanding and hypothesis is that blockchain technology in healthcare improves trust, transparency, patient empowerment, and in clinical trials, via process automation reduces human error, therefore increasing trial quality and patient safety at reduced cost.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Addeman said that, while this is the first application in clinical trials, he has seen increasing activity around blockchain in healthcare in the past year, much of it involving patient consent for access to their health records. Identity management and claims verification are two other hot topics. He said that while many blockchain use cases require a certain level of adoption before we see benefits, the BI project is exciting because it has the potential to immediately improve patient safety.<\/p>\n<p>It also has the potential to be used in multiple types of trial, according to Br\u00f6dl. &#8220;The concept should be applicable to any disease area and should be applicable to prevention trials as well as treatment trials,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;The technology and the value proposition of the technology are pretty much disease agnostic.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Results on the pilot projects are expected in the second half of this year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Boehringer Ingelheim (Canada) Ltd.

It was also the first laptop to trim the top bezel by embedding the webcam in the keyboard &#8211; although its success is debatable.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2019, Huawei released the Matebook 13 to bring the performance of the 14&#8243; Matebooks into a smaller form factor. Carrying a 13&#8243; display and a smaller body, the Matebook 13 is the most portable option in Huawei&#8217;s laptop portfolio. Despite a smaller body, it still sports an Intel 8th Gen quad-core processor, and can even be configured with dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics. Huawei is also adamant in keeping the dual fan cooler and has improved the fan blades to deliver more air.<\/p>\n<h3>Design<\/h3>\n<p>Is it blue or is it grey? That&#8217;s a matter of perspective. Tilt the surface at an angle, and the Matebook 13 shifts from navy blue to light grey, lending the product the illusion of a two-toned finish in my pictures. The coating resists fingerprints incredibly well, meaning less time spent wiping and more time working.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-13.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-415837\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-13.jpg 1781w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-13-768x451.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Sporting a full-metal body with sharp edges and smooth corners, the Matebook 13 is crafted with care and precision, and should withstand everyday handling with ease. Despite its premium materials, it still manages to keep the weight at 1.30 kg (2.87lbs) &#8211; only 50g heavier than the Macbook Air. The model without the Nvidia GeForce MX150 is slightly lighter at 1.27kg, or 2.82lbs.<\/p>\n<p>The slightly recessed power button has a fingerprint reader embedded within it. This is the Matebook\u2019s only method of biometrics sign-in as the webcam doesn\u2019t support Windows Hello facial recognition.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-415829\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13.jpg\" alt=\"Huawei Matebook 13 fingerprint reader\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13.jpg 1322w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Speaking of the webcam, the Matebook 13 now has it placed in an ultra-narrow bezel along the top, abandoning the keyboard pop-up camera design. Although the pop-up camera offers better privacy, many users didn\u2019t enjoy a video feed of their nostrils.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-5.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-415833\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-5.jpg\" alt=\"Huawei Matebook 13 camera\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A smaller display shrinks the chassis and increases portability. An unfortunate casualty of this design is the front-facing speakers, which now fire from the base. Their audio competency extends only as far as being able to produce sounds, and is subpar even compared to budget stereo systems. The shallow bass punches like a feather, tickling the tinny mids and weak treble.<\/p>\n<p>Two fans draw air from the rear mesh and expel it through the vents between the display and the base. Both fans are situated at the center, so make sure to leave a gap for them when the laptop is resting on the lap. When the fans are blocked, the Matebook 13 heats up noticeably faster.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-batch-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-415838\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-batch-2.jpg\" alt=\"Huawei Matebook 13 rear\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-batch-2.jpg 1580w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-batch-2-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The glossy logo has been replaced by a raised, textured print.

With a 25W TDP, it\u2019s far higher than the Intel integrated graphics. An anemic battery further compounds the concern.<\/p>\n<h4>Storage<\/h4>\n<p>Huawei selected the Western Digital Black SN750 SSD as the storage choice. It features Western Digital\u2019s 64-layer TLC NAND and its in-house controller. The i5 model comes with 256GB, while the i7 model comes with 512GB.<\/p>\n<p>The choice was excellent. The WD Black SN750 is blazing fast, maxing out at 3.5GB\/s in sequential read and 3GB\/s in sequential write. Random read and write is equally impressive, topping out at 52MB\/s and 202MB\/s respectively.<br \/>\n<a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-sn750-crystaldiskmark.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-416019 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-sn750-crystaldiskmark.png\" alt=\"Huawei Matebook 13 crystaldiskmark\" width=\"602\" height=\"548\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Overall system performance<\/h3>\n<p>PCMark10\u2019s productivity suite does an excellent job at evaluating overall system performance.

A heat pipe extends from the left and right heatsinks that covers the CPU and GPU respectively and into their dedicated fans in the center. Huawei updated the fan design to something called Shark Fin 2.0, which now delivers 25 per cent more airflow at the same rotation speed compared to Shark Fin 1.0.<\/p>\n<p>AIDA64\u2019s CPU stress test provided a good overview of how the laptop throttles. The Intel Core i7-8565U processor could maintain the advertised 4.0Ghz frequency on all cores for about four minutes, during which the temperature rises to 90C. After four minutes, all cores ramps back down to 2.3GHz, with the temperature kept at 80C and the fan speed lowered. At idle, the CPU cores ramped down to around 800MHz and temperature held steadfast at 41C. The fans were virtually silent.<\/p>\n<p>Under load, the top right quadrant was the hottest area, registering 44C on my infrared thermometer. The palm rest area and a majority of the keyboard never rose above 37C &#8211; still a bit warm, but not too bothersome.<\/p>\n<h3>Keyboard and touchpad<\/h3>\n<p>The Matebook 13 sacrifices the front-facing speakers, yet leaves enough room for a full-sized backlit keyboard &#8211; the arguably more important feature for professionals. The island keys are adequately spaced, which provides enough distinction when moving between one key to the next. The membrane switches feel slightly more tactile than the Matebook X Pro but are equally silent. I\u2019m impressed by the keyboards overall quality and have no qualms typing on it all day long.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-415832\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-4.jpg\" alt=\"Huawei Matebook 13 keybaord\" width=\"600\" height=\"408\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-4.jpg 1743w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-4-768x522.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The trackpad, on the other hand, is underwhelming. My review unit had a subtle yet annoying wobble, something that didn\u2019t exist on the 14\u201d Matebook X Pro. This could simply be a unit-specific issue, though I wonder how many more units like this passed QA.<\/p>\n<p>Compared to the trackpads on the Apple Macbooks and the Microsoft Surface laptop, the Matebook 13\u2019s is distinctly subpar. Huawei clearly cut some corners here by abandoning glass and using plastic instead. The material downgrade makes scrolling scratchy and rough. Tracking accuracy is good, although it did accidentally register several unintended clicks.<\/p>\n<h3>Battery life<\/h3>\n<p>In the ultrabook domain, The Matebook\u2019s 41.8Wh battery errs on the low-end. Though the capacity is common for devices in its class, the dedicated graphics processor requires more juice to achieve all-day battery life. Also, many other competitors feature much higher capacities. For example, the Dell XPS 13 has a 52Wh battery while the HP Spectre 13 has 61Wh. Since the Nvidia GeForce MX150 dedicated graphics and its cooling solution both take up a chunk of space, it\u2019s no surprise that Huawei trimmed the battery size.<\/p>\n<p>And that capacity constraint manifested in general productivity. It struggles to get through an entire workday of emails, writing, web browsing, and videos. More often than not, I reach for the charger after about 6 hours of use. As expected, heavier programs like Adobe Lightroom further reduces that benchmark.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, the Matebook 13 does charge very rapidly. A 15-minute charge can deliver enough juice for around 2 hours of light productivity.<\/p>\n<h3>Camera, ports, and I\/O<\/h3>\n<p>A grand total of three ports are installed on the Matebook 13: two USB-C ports and a headphone jack. The left USB port supports data and charging while the right supports data and DisplayPort.

Bumping that up to an Intel Core i7-8565U processor and a 512GB SSD increases the cost to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/Huawei-MateBook-Signature-Edn-Laptop\/dp\/B07MK3SP9R\/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=matebook+13&amp;qid=1552879744&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$1,749.99<\/a>. Maxing out the specs with the dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics pushes the price to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newegg.ca\/Product\/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAF0Y9096975&amp;Description=matebook%2013&amp;cm_re=matebook_13-_-9SIAF0Y9096975-_-Product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$1,928.99<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no question that the Matebook 13 is aimed at usurping Apple\u2019s 2018 MacBook Air, and in 2019, the MacBook Air just doesn&#8217;t feel all that competitive anymore. Whereas the MacBook Air sports a better display, the Matebook has superior processor performance and higher starting storage capacity &#8211; all at a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/ca\/shop\/buy-mac\/macbook-air\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$120<\/a> lower entry price. And although the MacBook Air&#8217;s touchpad is leagues above the Matebook&#8217;s, it&#8217;s keyboard&#8217;s shallow travel pales to the Huawei&#8217;s. With that said, the MacBook Air does have a distinct edge in battery life.<\/p>\n<p>The real competition, then, comes from manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Lenovo. The Dell XPS 13, HP Spectre series, and Lenovo&#8217;s ThinkPads all carry similar hardware to the Matebook 13 and have larger batteries to boot. The Lenovo ThinkPad, particularly the ThinkPad Carbon, is also renowned for its incredible durability. With that said, I haven&#8217;t had much time with any of these machines, so it&#8217;s tough to give one proper recommendation over another.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focusing on performance first, Huawei made little compromises to the Matebook 13\u2019s internals. The 8th-gen Intel quad-core processors, 8GB of RAM, and a dedicated graphics option handily cut through everyday productivity tasks and even light professional work. Its screen, while just averagely bright, is still plenty sharp, though I wished it could be a tad brighter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-glamour-shot-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-416021\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-glamour-shot-2.jpg\" alt=\"Huawei Matebook 13 coffee shop\" width=\"600\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-glamour-shot-2.jpg 1456w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/huawei-matebook-13-glamour-shot-2-768x633.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, its compromises in other areas become noticeable after prolonged use: a plastic trackpad just isn\u2019t as smooth nor as premium as the one on the Matebook X Pro; the 41.8Wh battery feels constrained, too, especially considering that the dedicated graphics need extra power when ramped up; and although its display deserves praise for its colors, brightness is lacking and light bleed is rampant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making these slight quality of life downgrades enables Huawei to clamp down the Matebook 13\u2019s pricing. Starting at $1,370, the comparatively cheaper pricing lands the Matebook 13 as an excellent choice for users seeking an ultra-portable device with powerful components. If you do pick one up, make sure to keep its charger with you at all times.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the nimbler counterpart to the 14&#8243; Matebook X and the Matebook X Pro, the Matebook 13 compresses the performance of its larger siblings into Huawei&#8217;s most portable offering yet.

Among the promises each country made was to set up a cyber Rapid Response Mechanism. This network will strengthen co-operation. between countries to identify and respond to diverse and evolving threats. Canada is the network co-ordinator, so the budget proposes giving the Global Affairs department $2.1 million over three years to help its work.<\/p>\n\n  <div id=\"relatedPosts\"  >\n<strong>Related Articles<\/strong><br\/> \n\n\n   \n<div class=\"category-listing\">\r\n\t<div class=\"span8 \">\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/article\/g7-vows-to-work-with-isps-social-media-to-fight-abuse-of-personal-data-by-foreign-actors\/406109\" class=\"float-left listing-image\" style=\"margin-right:10px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<img width=\"300\" height=\"120\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/FEATURE-G7-2018-300x120.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/FEATURE-G7-2018-300x120.jpg 300w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/FEATURE-G7-2018-100x40.jpg 100w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/FEATURE-G7-2018-620x250.jpg 620w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/FEATURE-G7-2018-140x55.jpg 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3 class=\"article-title\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/article\/g7-vows-to-work-with-isps-social-media-to-fight-abuse-of-personal-data-by-foreign-actors\/406109\">G7 vows to work with ISPs, social media to fight abuse of personal data by &#8216;foreign actors&#8217;<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"teaser-text\">Canada and others members of the G7 vowed in their final communique to work directly with Internet service providers and...<\/p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n<span class=\"metainfo\">\r\n \t\t<span class=\"publishedon\">June 10th, 2018<\/span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tHoward Solomon\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"twitter-handle\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/user?screen_name=HowardITWC\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t@HowardITWC\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/span><!-- metainfo -->\r\n   \r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\t\t\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n<\/div><!-- .category-listing -->\n   \n\n\t   <\/div> \n\t\n<p>It parallels the <a href=\"https:\/\/pesco.europa.eu\/project\/cyber-rapid-response-teams-and-mutual-assistance-in-cyber-security\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cyber Readiness Response Teams and Mutual Assistance in Cyber Security agreement<\/a> that some European countries set up in 2016 under the EU\u2019s Permanent Structure Co-operation (PESCO) on security and defence. Eight nations have or are setting up teams under the pact, which essentially established a collective cyber defence. To facilitate the teams one PESCO project is the creation of a cyber incident response information sharing platform.<\/p>\n<p>Twenty five of the EU&#8217;s 28 countries have joined PESCO, but most have not yet joined the cyber mutual assistance pact.<\/p>\n<p>One panel at Wednesday&#8217;s symposium discussed how PESCO &#8212; designed to increase EU co-operation &#8212; can work with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a military institution. Not all members of the EU are members of NATO.<\/p>\n<p>The other panel dealt with how to confront hybrid attacks, and included Air Commodore John Maas, senior military advisor to the European External Action Service; Colleen Merchant, director general of Public Safety Canada&#8217;s national cyber security directorate, Schroefl, and Satyamoorthy Kabilan, vice-president of policy for the Ottawa-based Public Policy Forum.<\/p>\n<p>In a pre-conference interview, Kabilan said one of the biggest problems in dealing with cyber attacks is attribution.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult to say definitively who&#8217;s behind a specific attack,&#8221; he pointed out. &#8220;In many cases there&#8217;s a little speculation involved. If you look at the number of attacks where people speculate nation-states are involved, and you look at the number where there have been indictments or statements from nations saying &#8216;X was responsible for attack Y,&#8217; there&#8217;s a huge difference.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And while it&#8217;s clear under NATO&#8217;s agreement when countries can come to the aid of another under physical attack, the rules are less clear when it comes to a cyber attack. That&#8217;s even more true for the world as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have nothing equivalent to the Geneva Convention when it comes to hybrid and cyber warfare,&#8221; Kabilan said. &#8220;So the line in the sand when you cross and it means, &#8216;This is an act of war&#8217; &#8212; there isn&#8217;t one when it comes to cyber.

That&#8217;s what some experts think happened in 2017 with the global spread\u00a0 of the NotPetya wiper malware. They believe it started as a Russia-backed attack on Ukraine by planting malware in a Ukranian accounting software package. But the malware spread around the world. Among the victims was the Maersk shipping company, which had to replace 4,000 new servers, 45,000 PCs, and 2,500 applications.<\/p>\n<p>Disinformation &#8212; better known as fake news &#8212; can be an effective weapon, but it isn&#8217;t in the same league as compromising critical infrastructure and &#8216;jiggling the handles&#8217; just to make people nervous. It does have the advantage, though, of being less messy than an invasion or a few warning shots across a border.<\/p>\n<p>A prime example of how big a disinformation campaign can go is the huge alleged Russia-directed\u00a0 effort during the 2016 U.S. elections &#8212; which included hacking email of staff from the Hilary Clinton campaign, and creating phony social media accounts to spread disinformation.\u00a0 There were also hacking incidents leading up to the recent German and French national elections.<\/p>\n\n  <div id=\"relatedPosts\"  >\n<strong>Related Articles<\/strong><br\/> \n\n\n   \n<div class=\"category-listing\">\r\n\t<div class=\"span8 \">\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/article\/how-to-attempt-to-influence-an-election-start-with-a-spear-phishing-campaign\/407102\" class=\"float-left listing-image\" style=\"margin-right:10px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<img width=\"300\" height=\"120\" src=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/FEATURE-US-election-vote-graphic-via-GETTY-300x120.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/FEATURE-US-election-vote-graphic-via-GETTY-300x120.jpg 300w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/FEATURE-US-election-vote-graphic-via-GETTY-100x40.jpg 100w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/FEATURE-US-election-vote-graphic-via-GETTY-620x250.jpg 620w, https:\/\/i.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/FEATURE-US-election-vote-graphic-via-GETTY-140x55.jpg 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>\t\t<\/a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3 class=\"article-title\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/article\/how-to-attempt-to-influence-an-election-start-with-a-spear-phishing-campaign\/407102\">How to attempt to influence an election: Start with a spear-phishing campaign<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"teaser-text\">Canadians worried about the possibility of a foreign government trying to secretly use the Internet to influence politics here could...<\/p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n<span class=\"metainfo\">\r\n \t\t<span class=\"publishedon\">July 16th, 2018<\/span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tHoward Solomon\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"twitter-handle\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/user?screen_name=HowardITWC\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t@HowardITWC\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t<\/span><!-- metainfo -->\r\n   \r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\t\t\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n<\/div><!-- .category-listing -->\n   \n\n\t   <\/div> \n\t\n<p>Disinformation is being confronted by governments encouraging social media platforms to crack down on suspicious content.

This fact begs the question of what must be done to plug the holes and cut down drastically on the number of breaches that are happening. Gaudet\u2019s answer: defence in depth.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe organizations we\u2019re working with are really focusing on defence in depth \u2014 implementing multiple layers of defence. No one layer is, on its own, going to be perfect, but the overall level of security increases as you add layers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that DNS is emerging as a key critical layer of defence. It has high value, requires a low level of effort to implement, and is really effective.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gaudet is crystal clear on why DNS is so highly effective.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s used by every application, whether malicious or good. It\u2019s used by every device on a network, from laptops to phone and any other device that uses DNS for communication. It\u2019s basically built into the fabric of the Internet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A key point is that over 91 per cent of malware uses DNS for command and control. \u201cSo by observing the DNS,\u201d said Gaudet, \u201cyou can see what malware is inside the network, and can provide another layer from which you can disable it. DNS is a layer of both defence <em>and <\/em>intelligence.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itworldcanada.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/CIRA_ITWC-Webinar_March-20.pdf\">Download a copy of the presentation<\/a> to find out how DNS helps organizations in the healthcare sector better secure their data.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mark Gaudet from the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA) bears some grim news about Canadian healthcare organizations today.
